## Task1. Implement Line Editor
#### Implement a simple text editor, where users can add, delete, and replace text lines. In addition, text lines can be written to a file or a list of text lines can be populated from a text file.

## Task2. Implement Sparse Polynomial
#### Sparse polynomials have many missing terms. In other words, coefficients for many terms are zero.  Linked list data structures are better for this kind of polynomial. Implement the sparse polynomial using a list data structure

## Task3. Solve Josephus Problem
#### There are n people (n is an even number) standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people m (m is an odd number) are skipped, and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
