#### 1.	Implement the following algorithms in Python. Test them using various input images.
##### 1) The floodfill method of Algorithm 4.5.

##### 3) Compute the region properties such as moments, area, perimeter, and centroid for each region obtained in step-2.

#### 2. Design a vision system to detect a binary template in an image. Assume that the template is at the same scale as the image, so that only translation needs to be taken into account. Use the chamfer distance to efficiently compute a matching score associated with each location in the image. Write code to implement this procedure, and display the probability map showing the matching score for each location in the image (ignoring the borders). Also, display a template-sized rectangle around the peak in the map.
