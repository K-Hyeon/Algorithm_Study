## Task1. Matrix Data Type
#### Develop a Matrix Data Type that has the following functionalities 
- __init__(row, col) : it initializes a matrix of size rows x cols with random values 
- __str__() : It returns the string representation of matrix
- __repr__() : It is representation of Matrix object
- __add__() : it multiplies two matrices and returns a resultant matrix
- __sub__() :  it subtracts two matrices and returns a resultant matrix
- __mul__() : it multiplies two matrices and returns a resultant matrix
- transpose() :It returns the transpose of the matrix

## Task2: EightQueens Data Type
- The eight-queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
- A basic iterative algorithm starts by initially place the eight queens at random on the board subject to the constraint that there is only one queen on each row and column
